# HuffMan_Coding_with_MATLAB
This code will be submitted to Profesor Park in KNU.
All code based on R2018b, No additional library used

## How Code Made
And I use Probability instead
There is no pointer in the MATLAB. But they can refer the Object instance.
So I can make Tree with pointing their child.
Code has Four Parts, FILE I/O, Validation Check for probability, Huffman Code Algorithm, Print Tree.

## 1. FILE I/O

## 2. Validation Check
1. Sum Cannot Exceed 1
2. Probability Cannot be lower than 0

## 3. Huffman Code Algorithm
1. Check 3 case
> 1-1. Both Two minimum probability node don't have root
>1-2. Either Two minimum probability have root or not
>1-3. Both Two minimum probability have root
